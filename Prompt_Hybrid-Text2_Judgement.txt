Judgement consists of these values: social esteem (sub-values normality, capacity and tenacity) and social sanction (sub-values veracity and propriety). Under Judgement, we are concerned with behavior and moral judgements, with positive and negative judgement values. Values can be realised as:

adverbials - justly, fairly, virtuously, honestly, pluckily, indefatigably, cleverly, stupidly, eccentrically

attributes and epithets (adjectives) - a corrupt politician, that was dishonest, don't be cruel, she's very brave, heâ€™s tireless, a skilful performer, truly eccentric behavior

nominals - a brutal tyrant, a cheat and a liar, a hero, a genius, a maverick

verbs - to cheat, to deceive, to sin, to lust after, to chicken out, to triumph.
