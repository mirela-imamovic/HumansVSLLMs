Appreciation consists of these values: reaction (sub-values impact, quality), composition (sub-values balance and complexity) and valuation. Under the subcategory of `social valueâ€™ (valuation), the object, product or process is evaluated according to various social conventions. In the context of the media texts under which much of this theory was developed, the key values were those of social significance or salience (whether the phenomenon was important, noteworthy, significant, crucial, etc) and of harm (whether the phenomenon was damaging, dangerous, unhealthy, etc).
